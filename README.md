## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language.

It was launched in 2015 by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) and has been running every year since.

Each year, 25 puzzles are realeased on a daily schedule from December 1st to December 25th. Each puzzle consists of two parts, with the second part only being unlocked after the first one has been solved.

## About this repo

I discovered Advent of Code in 2020 but never got the courage to actually solve any of the puzzles. In 2022 I've decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did.

In this repo I'll be posting my solutions to the puzzles. For the mostpart, I'll be using Python 3.11, although in some cases I will use other languages such as C.

In each year's folder you will find:

- `README.md` - A list of the puzzles and links to their solutions.
- `solutions/` - Folder containing the most optimal solutions I've been able to achieve.
- `original-solutions/` - Folder containing my original solutions to the puzzles. These are not necessarily the most optimal solutions, but they are the ones I came up with first.
- `inputs/` - Folder containing the input files for each puzzle.
